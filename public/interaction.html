                  <p>Clinical trial randomization is the process of assigning people by chance to groups that receive different interventions or drugs in later phase trials. A computer is most often used to assign people to groups.</p>
                  <p>Randomization helps prevent bias, ensuring that the trial's results are not affected by human choices or other factors not related to the treatment being tested.</p>

                  <p>Placebos are rarely used in cancer treatment clinical trials. In most cases, one group receives the new treatment, while another receives the already approved standard treatment. Researchers then compare the two treatments to see if the new treatment will become the new standard.</p>
                  <p>If placebos are used, you will always be informed ahead of time, and you can ask questions before deciding to join the trial. The use of placebos will be covered in the consent form.</p>

                  <ul>
                      <li><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Supervises all aspects of a clinical trial, including protocol submission, participant recruitment, and data analysis.</li>

              <section>
                  <p>Each clinical trial that is funded by the federal government must be reviewed by scientists from relevant fields before people can enroll.</p>
                  <p>This expert review ensures that the trial is based on sound science. Though not required, many other clinical trial sponsors, such as drug companies, also seek expert advice on the scientific merit of their trials before opening them.</p>
                  <p>If you take part in a clinical trial, your safety will be protected through the informed consent process, careful review and approval of the clinical trial protocol, and ongoing monitoring.</p>
              </section>
      
              <section>
                  <h2>Informed Consent in Clinical Trials</h2>
                  <p>Informed consent is an essential process through which the research team explains the trial to you before you decide whether to take part.</p>
                  <p>The research team explains the trial’s purpose, procedures, and possible risks and benefits. You have the right to ask questions and learn about all that is involved in the trial, including all your treatment options, details about treatment, tests, and possible risks and benefits.</p>
                  <p>After discussing the study with you, the research team will give you an informed consent form to read. The form includes written details about the information that was discussed with you and describes the privacy of your medical records. If you agree to take part in the study, you sign the form.</p>
                  <p>Even after you sign the consent form, you can leave the study at any time. You can always ask questions. And as new information becomes available, the research team will inform you.</p>

              <section>
                  <h2>Children’s Assent</h2>
                  <p>Children are not able to give informed consent until they turn 18. Before taking part in a clinical trial, they are asked for their assent. Assent means that they agree to take part.</p>
                  <p>To take part in the assent process, your child must be mature enough to understand the trial and what they are required to do. Some children as young as 7 years old may be able to take part in the assent process.</p>
                  <p>As with the informed consent process, the assent process is meant to be an ongoing conversation between your child, your family, and the research team. During the assent process:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The research team explains the trial to you and your child.</li>
                      <li>You give informed permission for your child to join the clinical trial.</li>
                      <li>The research team explains the trial to your child in language they can understand.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Both parents usually need to give permission unless certain conditions apply.</p>

                  <h2>Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)</h2>
                  <p>IRBs review clinical trial protocols before clinical trials can accept patients. They check to see that the trial is well-designed, legal, and ethical; does not involve unneeded risks; and includes a safety plan for patients.</p>

              <section>
                  <h2>Data and Safety Monitoring Boards (DSMBs)</h2>
                  <p>Some clinical trials—especially phase 3—use a data and safety monitoring board (DSMB). Like IRBs, these boards review the progress of a clinical trial and monitor the safety of those taking part in the trial.</p>
                  <p>A DSMB is an independent group of doctors, statisticians, and others who are experts in clinical research and clinical trials.</p>

              <section>
                  <p>You may be wondering if clinical trials cost money and who pays for them.</p>
                  <p>Many clinical trial costs are covered by the sponsor of the study, a patient's insurance plan if one is available, and sometimes there are out-of-pocket costs. Before you join a study, ask the study coordinator which costs are covered and which are not.</p>

                  <p>Learn about the different types of costs related to taking part in a clinical trial, and who is expected to pay for which costs.</p>
                  <p>Patient care costs are those costs that you would pay even if you weren’t in a trial. These costs are often covered by health insurance.</p>
                  <p>Types of patient care costs may include:</p>

                  <h2>Research Costs in Clinical Trials</h2>
                  <p>Research costs are those costs that are related to taking part in the trial. Often these costs are not covered by health insurance. But they may be covered by the trial’s sponsor.</p>
                  <p>Examples of research costs include:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The study drug</li>
                      <li>Lab tests performed purely for research purposes</li>
                      <li>Added x-rays and imaging tests performed solely for the trial</li>
                      <li>Extra doctor visits that you would not have with usual care</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>When you take part in a trial, you may have extra doctor visits that you would not have with usual care. During these visits, your doctor carefully watches for side effects and your safety in the study.</p>

                  <h2>Are Clinical Trials Covered by Insurance?</h2>
                  <p>Before you join a trial, learn as much as you can about which costs you or your health plan need to pay and those that will be covered by the study. Talk with your doctor, the research team, and your health plan.</p>
                  <p>Ask your doctor if there is someone on staff who can help work with your health plan. This person might be a financial counselor or research coordinator. Or they might work in the hospital's patient finance department.</p>
                  <p>Ask the research coordinator or nurse if other people have had problems getting their health plans to cover routine patient care costs. If so, you might ask the research coordinator or nurse for help in sending information to your health plan that explains why this clinical trial might be a good fit for you. Items insurance companies may ask for include:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Medical journal articles that show possible patient benefits from the drug or procedure that is being tested</li>
                      <li>A letter from your doctor that explains the trial or why it is a reasonable option for you</li>
                      <li>Support letters from patient advocacy groups</li>
                  </ul>

              <section>
                  <h2>How to Work with Health Insurance Plans</h2>
                  <p>Call your health insurance plan. If your doctor does not have a staff person to help work with health plans, call the customer service number on the back of your insurance card. Here are important questions to ask:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Does the health plan cover routine patient care costs for people taking part in clinical trials?</li>
                      <li>If so, is a pre-authorization required?</li>
                      <li>If your health plan requires a pre-authorization, what information do you need to provide?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Understand all the costs related to the trial. Ask your doctor or the trial's contact person about the costs that must be covered by you or your health plan.</p>

              <section>
                  <h2>What Happens If My Claim Is Denied?</h2>
                  <p>If your claim is denied, contact your insurance plan's billing office for help. The billing manager may know how to appeal your health plan’s decision.</p>
                  <p>You can also read your health insurance policy to find out what steps you can follow to make an appeal. Ask your doctor to help you. It might help if they contact the medical director of your health plan.</p>

                  <h2>Joining a Clinical Trial Without Insurance</h2>
                  <p>If you don’t have insurance or have other financial worries that you think may prevent you from taking part in a clinical trial, there are places to go for help.</p>
                  <p>Some screening, prevention, and quality-of-life studies take place at sites that serve people with low incomes through the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP). If you receive health care at one of these sites, you may be able to take part in a clinical trial.</p>
                  <p>People with cancer may be able to enroll in National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) clinical trials through NCORP as well. Check with the clinic where you receive care about studies that you might be eligible for.</p>

                  <h2>Federal Health Insurance and Programs for Clinical Trials</h2>
                  <p>Some federal health insurance programs help pay the costs of care in clinical trials.</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Medicaid: Covers all routine patient care costs in a clinical trial.</li>
                      <li>Medicare: May reimburse some costs related to trials of new cancer treatments.</li>
                      <li>TRICARE: Covers medical costs related to NCI-sponsored trials for cancer prevention and treatment.</li>

                    <p class="subtitle">Brief Summary:</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the present study is to utilize Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to test four social support and mindfulness components (e-coaching, buddy, general mindfulness training, and MVPA-specific mindfulness training) in a 12-week mHealth moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) intervention in a sample of young adult cancer survivors (YACS), to improve quality of life (QOL) and decrease adverse effects and symptom burden.</p>
                    <p>PRIMARY AIM: To identify which components from four mHealth components under consideration for inclusion meaningfully contribute to improvements in MVPA at 12 and 24 weeks</p>
                    <p>SECONDARY AIM: To examine how changes in MVPA, as a result of Opt2Move components, may influence additional health behaviors and outcomes including: a) symptom burden (i.e., fatigue, depression, anxiety); b) time spent in other activity intensities (i.e., light, sedentary time); and c) sleep duration and quality</p>
                    <p>THIRD AIM: To examine potential mediators (i.e., adherence, psychosocial factors such as post-traumatic growth, self-compassion, self-efficacy, and goal setting) and moderators (cancer type, age, gender) of the four intervention components on MVPA.</p>
