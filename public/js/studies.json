        "detailedDescription": "The purpose of the present study is to utilize Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST)1 to test four social support and mindfulness components (e-coaching, buddy, general mindfulness training, and MVPA-specific mindfulness training) in a 12-week mHealth moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) intervention in a sample of young adult cancer survivors (YACS), to improve quality of life (QOL) and decrease adverse effects and symptom burden.\n\nPRIMARY AIM To identify which components from four mHealth components under consideration for inclusion meaningfully contribute to improvements in MVPA at 12 and 24 weeks\n\nSECONDARY AIM To examine how changes in MVPA, as a result of Opt2Move components, may influence additional health behaviors and outcomes including: a) symptom burden (i.e. fatigue, depression, anxiety); b) time spent in other activity intensities (i.e. light, sedentary time); and c) sleep duration and quality\n\nTHIRD AIM To examine potential mediators (i.e. adherence, psychosocial factors such as post-traumatic growth, self-compassion, self-efficacy, and goal setting) and moderators (cancer type, age, gender) of the four intervention components on MVPA.\n\nResearch participants will be identified and recruited at Robert H. Lurie Cancer Center (RHLCC) at Northwestern University (NU) and at the Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC) at Wake Forest University (WFU). All YACS and Buddies will complete an initial 10-15 minute eligibility screening online, over the phone, or in-person. The study RA will obtain informed consent and HIPAA authorization from eligible participants according to IRB approved procedures. After consent is received, all additional study procedures (i.e. assessments, orientation, intervention delivery, etc.) will be handled by the coordinating center (NU) to ensure all procedures are implemented consistently and improve efficiency.\n\nAssessments. After informed consent completion, the NU study team will send participants an email with an individual, secure link to study questionnaires and notification that an ActiGraph accelerometer packet has been mailed. Participants will be asked to complete the questionnaire within 1 week of receipt. YACS will be provided with detailed written instructions for how to wear the ActiGraph.\n\nRandomization and Study Orientation. After completing baseline assessments, YACS (n=304) will be randomized to each group using computer-generated randomly permuted blocks. After randomization, the NU study team will send the participant an intervention packet which will include the Fitbit, Fitbit instructions, instructions and a QR code to download the Opt2Move app, and instructions specific to each condition to which they are assigned. The participant will also be scheduled for an orientation phone or web call with study staff to go over the contents of the intervention packet and expectations of participation for each component in greater detail.\n\nIntervention Components\n\nCore Intervention (Fitbit + Opt2Move App). All participants will receive a low-resource self-monitoring intervention consisting of the Fitbit AltaHR (or similar) and the Opt2Move self-monitoring app. Participants will be asked to download the Fitbit app and wear the Fitbit 24/7 throughout the 24-week study period. The core OPTIMAL AYAO app will support YACS to increase their MVPA. Participants will be provided with a weekly MVPA goal to build efficacy and ensure safe progression towards the overall goal of 150 minutes per week. Participants will be instructed to self-monitor progress towards these goals via feedback on Fitbit Alta HR and the daily, weekly and monthly progress information provided in the Opt2Move app.\n\nBuddy. Participants assigned to this condition will select a buddy of their choice (i.e. friend, co-worker, caregiver or family member) that is ≥ 18 years of age and willing to share their Fitbit data with the study team. The study team will reach out to the buddy via an email containing a description of the expectations of the buddy and a link to complete online screening. The buddy will be mailed a Fitbit, share their Fitbit data with the study team, and be provided with access to, and instructions for, all of the Opt2Move app modules the participant has access to for their assigned condition. The buddy will be expected to attend a 15-30 minute group orientation call and listen to four 10-15 minute podcasts (one every 3 weeks) during the 12 week intervention. Each podcast will provide social support training and peer discussion of challenges and successes in providing YACS with MVPA support.\n\nE-coaching. Participants assigned to this condition will receive a weekly scheduled text message from their coach. Text messages will focus on building self-efficacy and self-regulation skills, setting realistic outcome expectations, overcoming barriers, and problem-solving and will directly support the participant's engagement in the intervention. The coach will provide a brief overview of the participant's recent progress and goals, ask if they are having any barriers and help them troubleshoot and set specific goals for the next week. In addition to the scheduled messaging, participants will also be instructed to reach out to their coach with any questions or for additional assistance. The coach will respond within 24 hours (weekdays) to 48 hours (weekends), maximum.\n\nGeneral Mindfulness Training. Participants assigned to this condition will be instructed to watch 1 (1-2 mins), mindfulness education videos each week which lay the foundation for what mindfulness is and how it can be an important health behavior. Each week participants will also be asked to listen to general guided mindfulness audio files ≥5 days/ week. The length of recordings will gradually increase each week from 3-5 to 25-30 minutes. All videos and recording will be available via the Opt2Move app.\n\nMVPA-Specific Mindfulness Training. Participants assigned to the MVPA-specific mindfulness training component will be instructed to watch 1-2 brief (1-2 minute), mindfulness education videos each week which lay the foundation for what mindfulness is and the importance of linking mindful awareness with MVPA. Each week participants will be provided access to MVPA-specific guided mindfulness audio files (e.g., 10-minute treadmill walking meditation, 20-minute bicycling meditation) that they will be asked to listen to during ≥3 MVPA sessions/week. The length and intensity of these audio files will correspond to their progression in the program. All videos and recording will be accessed via the Opt2Move app.\n\nFollow-up. Participants will be instructed to maintain their MVPA during the 12-week follow-up period. They will have access to all materials to which they were assigned to less any direct contact from the study team."

The effects of the four individual intervention components and their combinations will be examined via a full factorial experiment. The investigators chose a factorial experimental design because these designs have two characteristics essential to the success of MOST. They: a) separate component effects enabling the estimation of the main effect of each candidate component and interactions between components and b) are more economical compared to alternative designs because they often require substantially fewer subjects to achieve the same power and use less resources. The investigators are using a full factorial experiment with 2\\^4=16 experimental conditions.",

            "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to examine the implementation and effectiveness of the psychosocial eHealth intervention, My Wellbeing Guide, on the proposed primary outcome, depressive symptoms, in patients diagnosed with cancer who receive care at Northwestern Medicine and the University of Miami Health System.\n\nThe intervention includes cognitive behavioral therapy management strategies for health-related stress in the form of animated videos, interactive activities, and written content. The intervention will be delivered via an online application over an 7-week period. Intervention participants will also complete four assessments: baseline (at the beginning of the research study), post-intervention (7 weeks after baseline), a 6-month follow-up, and a 12-month follow up.\n\nParticipants are randomized into either an intervention application (described above) or a control application (which will provide links to helpful resources for patients with cancer, such as the contact information for cancer support services at Northwestern University and the University of Miami, and the link to the National Cancer Institute website, and the American Cancer Society website.) Control participants will also complete four assessments: baseline (at the beginning of the research study), post-intervention (7 weeks after baseline), a 6-month follow-up, and a 12-month follow up.",
            "detailedDescription": "Depression is one of the most common psychological comorbidities experienced throughout the cancer continuum. Elevated depressive symptoms in oncology patients is a major concern as unmanaged depressive symptoms in cancer patients is associated with poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL), poor adherence to cancer treatments, delayed return to work and baseline function, greater emergency department visits, and higher all-cause mortality. Behavioral interventions for the management of depression are efficacious, but scalability and implementation of these evidence-based interventions in oncology is limited. Health information technologies (HIT) provide an ideal opportunity to expedite the administration, scoring, and interpretation of depression screening with well-validated, brief and precise measurement tools that can capture actionable data to screen for depression, and deliver pragmatic and scalable evidence-based behavioral interventions that are proven to reduce depressive symptomatology across various other populations.\n\nThe study takes place across two distinct health systems in two major metropolitan areas-Chicago and Miami (Northwestern Medicine and University of Miami Health System). While across the two health systems (NM and UHealth), patients already receive EHR-delivered assessments that are linked to EPIC and real-time alerts sent to supportive oncology for patients with moderately to severely elevated symptoms, a lacking component is the integration of an evidence-based, HIT management program for elevated depressive symptoms.\n\nThe investigators will evaluate the effectiveness and the implementation of an evidence-based HIT behavioral treatment for cancer patients with elevated depressive symptoms. This HIT treatment combines systematic, electronic health record-integrated screening for depressive symptoms with an individually-tailored HIT interventions to address gaps in the treatment of depression among cancer patients. The investigators' specific aims are as follows:\n\nAim 1a. To further develop and refine My Wellbeing Guide, a web-based platform to optimize management of elevated depressive symptoms in ambulatory oncology in two large health systems.\n\nAim 1b. To establish the effectiveness of My Wellbeing Guide on depressive symptoms (i.e., primary outcome) and anxiety, HRQoL, and health services utilization (i.e. secondary outcomes), and putative mechanisms of action/mediators (e.g., self -efficacy) of My Wellbeing Guide on study outcomes compared to usual care.\n\nAim 1c. To evaluate the process of implementing My Wellbeing Guide and its impact on patient and system-level outcomes through electronic health record (EHR) extractions of Aim 1b patients, and through clinician, and hospital administrator interviews.\n\nAim 2. To identify facilitators and barriers to wide-scale implementation and expansion of My Wellbeing Guide through interviews and focus groups with stakeholders (clinicians, hospital administrators, and patients who participated in My Wellbeing Guide)."

The goal of this study is to evaluate the acceptability of procedures for a future trial in which the investigators will test which component or combination of components meaningfully contribute to improvements in depressive symptoms among AYAs. Additionally, the investigators will evaluate study feasibility as well as intervention acceptability, satisfaction, usability, and engagement."

All users will have access to the core tool which includes daily mood tracking and a psychoeducational module about cancer and depression. Depending on assigned condition, participants will also receive access to up to 4 intervention modules which have been adapted from existing evidence-based treatments for digital delivery to AYAs through a rigorous user-centered design process. Within each module there are 6 micro-lessons that include an educational video, a real story from an AYA that demonstrates the topic, multiple choice questions that ask the participant to apply the educational information to the AYA story, open-ended questions that ask the participant to apply the educational information to their own experience, and a practice activity in which they are asked to try out a relevant skill.",
